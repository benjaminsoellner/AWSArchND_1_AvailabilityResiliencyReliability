The database probably will have a minimum RTO and RPO of a few seconds to fail over from one AZ to another as can be seen when rebooting the RDS with failover.

Should a region fail, however, then the RTO and RPO would be many minutes or even hours since a manual intervention (promoting the standby database) needs to be taken.
